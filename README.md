# Tic Tac Toe React (WORK IN PROGRESS)

This application serves as a stand alone tic tac toe game. 
The application was made with `react.js`, and `redux` as the offical
state manager. 

# Description
Upon clicking the official url to the game, you will be presented with
the home screen where you can choose what side goes first. You can choose to go against 
the computer or someone else.

# Technologies
`React.js`
`Redux`

# Challenges and Purpose
This app excercises the important concept of state and state management when working in a 
versatile front-end framework such as react. The hardest part about building this app is the maintain 
all the different states that are involved in the logical process of a tic-tac-toe game. 

Another challenge was determining how the application would come to a conclusion
of who won the game. I chose to map out the entire 3 x 3 board and list all the different
possibilties of winning the game. I'm sure there is a nice combinatorial solution so such 
an intricate problemn, but I resorted to pure investigative efforts rather than theoretical/mathematical.
